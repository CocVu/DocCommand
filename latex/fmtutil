#!fmtutil --help
fmtutil version r44190 (2017-05-04 23:38:43 +0200)
Usage: fmtutil      [-user|-sys] [OPTION] ... [COMMAND]
   or: fmtutil-sys  [OPTION] ... [COMMAND]
   or: fmtutil-user [OPTION] ... [COMMAND]
   or: mktexfmt  FORMAT.fmt|BASE.base|FMTNAME.EXT

Rebuild and manage TeX fmts and Metafont bases, collectively called
"formats" here. (MetaPost no longer uses the past-equivalent "mems".)

If the command name ends in mktexfmt, only one format can be created.
The only options supported are --help and --version, and the command
line must be either a format name, with extension, or a plain name that
is passed as the argument to --byfmt (see below).  The full name of the
generated file (if any) is written to stdout, and nothing else.

If not operating in mktexfmt mode, exactly one command must be given,
extensions should generally not be specified, no non-option arguments
are allowed, and multiple formats can be generated, as follows.

By default, the return status is zero if all formats requested are
successfully built, else nonzero.

Options:
  --sys                   use TEXMFSYS{VAR,CONFIG}
  --user                  use TEXMF{VAR,CONFIG}
  --cnffile FILE          read FILE instead of fmtutil.cnf
                           (can be given multiple times, in which case
                           all the files are used)
  --fmtdir DIR            write formats under DIR instead of TEXMF[SYS]VAR
  --no-engine-subdir      don't use engine-specific subdir of the fmtdir
  --no-error-if-no-format exit successfully if no format is selected
  --no-error-if-no-engine=ENGINE1,ENGINE2,...
                          exit successfully even if a required engine
                           is missing, if it is included in the list.
  --no-strict             exit successfully even if a format fails to build
  --nohash                don't update ls-R files
  --recorder              pass the -recorder option and save .fls files
  --quiet                 be silent
  --catcfg                (does nothing, exists for compatibility)
  --dolinks               (does nothing, exists for compatibility)
  --force                 (does nothing, exists for compatibility)
  --test                  (does nothing, exists for compatibility)

Commands:
  --all                   recreate all format files
  --missing               create all missing format files
  --refresh               recreate only existing format files
  --byengine ENGINE       (re)create formats built with ENGINE
  --byfmt FORMAT          (re)create format FORMAT
  --byhyphen HYPHENFILE   (re)create formats that depend on HYPHENFILE
  --enablefmt  FORMAT[/ENGINE] enable FORMAT, as built with ENGINE
  --disablefmt FORMAT[/ENGINE] disable FORMAT, as built with ENGINE
                          If multiple formats have the same name and
                           different engines, /ENGINE specifier is required.
  --listcfg               list (enabled and disabled) configurations,
                           filtered to available formats
  --showhyphen FORMAT     print name of hyphen file for FORMAT
  --version               show version information and exit
  --help                  show this message and exit

Explanation of trees and files normally used:

  If --cnffile is specified on the command line (possibly multiple
  times), its value(s) are used.  Otherwise, fmtutil reads all the
  fmtutil.cnf files found by running `kpsewhich -all fmtutil.cnf', in the
  order returned by kpsewhich.

  In any case, if multiple fmtutil.cnf files are found, all the format
  definitions found in all the fmtutil.cnf files are merged.

  Thus, if fmtutil.cnf files are present in all trees, and the default
  layout is used as shipped with TeX Live, the following files are
  read, in the given order.
  
  For fmtutil-sys:
  TEXMFSYSCONFIG $TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
  TEXMFSYSVAR    $TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
  TEXMFLOCAL     $TEXLIVE/texmf-local/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
  TEXMFDIST      $TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

  For fmtutil-user:
  TEXMFCONFIG    $HOME/.texliveYYYY/texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
  TEXMFVAR       $HOME/.texliveYYYY/texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
  TEXMFHOME      $HOME/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
  TEXMFSYSCONFIG $TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
  TEXMFSYSVAR    $TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
  TEXMFLOCAL     $TEXLIVE/texmf-local/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
  TEXMFDIST      $TEXLIVE/YYYY/texmf-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
  
  (where YYYY is the TeX Live release version).
  
  According to the actions, fmtutil might write to one of the given files
  or create a new fmtutil.cnf, described further below.

Where formats are written:
  
  By default, format files are (re)written in TEXMFSYSVAR/ENGINE by
  fmtutil-sys, and TEXMFVAR/ENGINE by fmtutil, where /ENGINE is a
  subdirectory named for the engine used, such as "pdftex".
  
  If the --fmtdir=DIR option is specified, DIR is used instead of
  TEXMF[SYS]VAR, but the /ENGINE subdir is still used by default.
  
  In any case, if the --no-engine-subdir option is specified, the
  /ENGINE subdir is omitted.
  
Where configuration changes are saved: 

  If config files are given on the command line, then the first one 
  given will be used to save any changes from --enable or --disable.  
  If the config files are taken from kpsewhich output, then the 
  algorithm is more complex:

    1) If $TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/fmtutil.cnf or $TEXMFHOME/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
    appears in the list of used files, then the one listed first by
    kpsewhich --all (equivalently, the one returned by kpsewhich
    fmtutil.cnf), is used.
      
    2) If neither of the above two are present and changes are made, a
    new config file is created in $TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/fmtutil.cnf.
  
  In general, the idea is that if a given config file is not writable, a
  higher-level one can be used.  That way, the distribution's settings
  can be overridden system-wide using TEXMFLOCAL, and system settings
  can be overridden again in a particular user's TEXMFHOME.

Resolving multiple definitions of a format:

  If a format is defined in more than one config file, then the definition
  coming from the first-listed fmtutil.cnf is used.

Disabling formats:

  fmtutil.cnf files with higher priority (listed earlier) can disable
  formats in lower priority (listed later) fmtutil.cnf files by
  writing a line like
    #! <fmtname> <enginename> <hyphen> <args>
  in the higher-priority fmtutil.cnf file.   The #! must be at the
  beginning of the line, with at least one space or tab afterward, and
  there must be whitespace between each word on the list.

  For example, you can disable the luajitlatex format by creating
  the file $TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/fmtutil.cnf with the line
    #! luajitlatex luajittex language.dat,language.dat.lua lualatex.ini
  (As it happens, the luajittex-related formats are precisely why the
  --no-error-if-no-engine option exists, since luajittex cannot be
  compiled on all platforms.)

fmtutil-user (fmtutil -user) vs. fmtutil-sys (fmtutil -sys):

  When fmtutil-sys is run or the command line option -sys is used, 
  TEXMFSYSCONFIG and TEXMFSYSVAR are used instead of TEXMFCONFIG and 
  TEXMFVAR, respectively.  This is the primary difference between 
  fmtutil-sys and fmtutil-user.

  See http://tug.org/texlive/scripts-sys-user.html for details.

  Other locations may be used if you give them on the command line, or
  these trees don't exist, or you are not using the original TeX Live.

Supporting development binaries

  If an engine name ends with "-dev", formats are created in
  the respective directory with the -dev stripped.  This allows for
  easily running development binaries in parallel with the released
  binaries.
